    Development mode has been added to Deckhand, allowing for the possibility
    of running Deckhand without Keystone. A new paste file has been added
    to ``etc/deckhand`` called ``noauth-paste.ini`` which excludes Keystone
    authentication. To run Deckhand in development mode, issue::

        ./entrypoint.sh server --development-mode

    from the root Deckhand directory. Note that Deckhand will expect to find
    ``noauth-paste.ini`` on the host with the ``--development-mode`` flag.
