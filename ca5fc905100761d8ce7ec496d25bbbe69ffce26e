      "message": "I think that if we want to introduce a way of toggling development mode it should be done consistently across both patch sets. Instead of passing in `--development-mode` to entrypoint.sh we could just introduce this option and use it in both patch sets. But maybe we can make the change in both places in this patch set instead.",
