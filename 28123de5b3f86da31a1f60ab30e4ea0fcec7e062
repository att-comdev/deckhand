      "message": "Thanks for the review. The code is actually wonky, now that I look at it. I think the case above handles this as well. I\u0027ll try removing this entire block of code, updating this function with a detailed docstring, and re-comitting.\n\nClearly if documents is initialized above (L27), then so will resp_list, meaning that L43 will probably never be executed, so I think it\u0027s actually dead code.",
