      "message": "so only secrets can have encrypted storage policy? I thought storage policy drove whether or not things were encrypted, and anything COULD be stored encrypted. Maybe I\u0027m remembering wrong or missing the point?  I know in later parts of this PS, we drive based on storage policy without talking about secrets.  This might be 100% correct, just want to make sure.",

      "message": "so.. if I have auth to see encrypted, I can see encrypted parts of the design, but not cleartext?  Seems like there is a logical hierarchy here, or perhaps a flag for \"unmask encrypted\" that would require additional authorization?  Mostly it seems strange that I could have permission to see encrypted, but not cleartext.",
