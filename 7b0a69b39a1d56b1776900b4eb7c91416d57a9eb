      "message": "Good to understand this limitation.  I wonder if we should consider more detailed content type header that specifies the difference?  e.g.  application/x-yaml+multidoc\n\nRegardless, I\u0027m OK with the workaround above for now.  Bryan might have some thoughts about a more specific content type.",

      "message": "I find content type to be one of those things I want to love but in practice... not so much love.  For example, we maybe should be using text/yaml, but yaml isn\u0027t registered, and it\u0027s questionable if these yaml\u0027s are workable without being processed by an application... so maybe text/x-yaml, or application/x-yaml.  Or maybe because of how registration is worked... text/x.yaml  but the x is discouraged, so maybe text/yaml.  +multidoc is yet more dreamup, and maybe we should use multipart to match form submission.  But it\u0027s not really like that either.  Perhaps our type should be application/yaml+sitedesign, since we could be semantically defining what a sitedesign is.\n\nI\u0027m fine with application/x-yaml+multidoc if you gain anything by it.",
