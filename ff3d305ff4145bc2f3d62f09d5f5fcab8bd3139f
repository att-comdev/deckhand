      "message": "Child B and Child C must be able to select Parent A, or else Parent A isn\u0027t their parent. Child B then needs to have replacement: true. At this point, Child B should replace Parent A when Child C attempts to layer with Parent A. \n\nOtherwise it\u0027s not possible for Child B to replace anything if its parent can\u0027t be found. That being said, I don\u0027t think I have validation that checks whether a parent was found AND you have replacement: true. There are a lot of validations that need to be run dynamically in this case as so many things can be overlooked/wrong in the documents themselves.",
